<p>The first major hurdle you encounter when learning Linux is actually getting Linux installed on your computer.
Installing a completely foreign operating system is daunting, and you are not willing to risk breaking your current Windows installation.
Fortunately we can use Cygwin, VirtualBox, and Vagrant to learn Linux without touching our current Windows installation.</p>
<p>In this article we'll create a virtual machine that has Linux already installed.
Then you can play around with Linux in the virtual machine, and if you break something you can spawn a new virtual machine with a fresh Linux install.
Using a virtual machine is a great way to work with Linux without altering your current Windows setup.</p>
<h1>Cygwin</h1>
<p>The first piece of software we'll need is Cygwin.
Cygwin provides us with a Linux-like command line environment within Windows.</p>
<h2>Cygwin Intro</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to understand about Cygwin is that Cygwin is not a single program.
Cygwin is an environment that contains many programs and packages.
You can add or remove programs and packages from your Cygwin environment using the Cygwin Setup program.
The "setup.exe" file that you download from the Cygwin website is the Cygwin Setup program.</p>
<h2>Download Cygwin Setup</h2>
<p>Please use the button below to download Cygwin Setup now.</p>
<p><a href="https://cygwin.com/install.html" class="btn btn-lg btn-success" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt"></span> Download Cygwin</a></p>
<p>After you've downloaded the Cygwin Setup program, move the setup.exe file to a convenient permanent location.
Cygwin Setup will cache downloaded packages and package metadata in the same directory as the setup.exe file.
Typically, you keep setup.exe in the same place to take advantage of the caching feature.
I usually place my setup.exe file in <code>C:\cygwin-setup</code>.</p>
<h2>Run Cygwin Setup</h2>
<p>Now we're ready to run Cygwin Setup and install our first Cygwin packages.
Double click the setup.exe file to run Cygwin Setup.</p>
<h3>1. Welcome Screen</h3>
<p>This welcome screen has some good information.
Give it a read, then click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-01.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Welcome screen"></p>
<h3>2. Choose Package Source</h3>
<p>Choose "Install from Internet".</p>
<p>Click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-02.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Choose package source"></p>
<h3>3. Choose Cygwin Root Directory</h3>
<p>Select the root directory where your Cygwin environment will be installed.
I usually choose <code>C:\cygwin</code> for my Cygwin root directory.</p>
<p>Click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-03.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Choose Cygwin root directory"></p>
<h3>4. Choose Package Cache Directory</h3>
<p>Choose where you want Cygwin Setup to store its cached package files.
I usually store cached package files right next to setup.exe in <code>C:\cygwin-setup</code>.</p>
<p>Click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-04.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Choose package cache directory"></p>
<h3>5. Configure Network Settings</h3>
<p>Configure network settings appropriate for your Internet connection. I find that "Direct Connection" works well for me.</p>
<p>Click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-05.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Configure network settings"></p>
<h3>6. Choose a Mirror</h3>
<p>The official Cygwin package repository is available from multiple servers throughout the world.
They all have the same Cygwin packages available, but download times vary from server to server.
I usually just pick one at random.</p>
<p>If you get slow download speeds, try a different mirror.
You can check out the <a href="https://cygwin.com/mirrors.html">Cygwin mirrors list</a> and select a mirror that is close to your geographic location.</p>
<p>Choose a mirror, then click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-06.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Choose a mirror"></p>
<h3>7. Downloading Package Metadata</h3>
<p>Cygwin Setup downloads the latest package metadata from your selected mirror and updates its local cache.</p>
<p>Sit back and let the download finish.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-07.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Downloading package metadata"></p>
<h3>8. Select Packages to Install</h3>
<p>Now we're ready to browse for packages and select the packages we want to install.</p>
<p>But first, let's explore the Cygwin package browser a little.
Right now we're looking at all Cygwin packages, organized by category.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-08.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Package browser"></p>
<p>Click the <code>View</code> button twice to switch to the "Pending" view.
The "Pending" view shows the packages that are currently selected for installation.
Hover your mouse over the <code>View</code> button for an explanation of the different views.</p>
<p>Right now all of the packages under the "Base" category are selected for installation. The Base category includes all packages required for a minimal Cygwin installation.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-09.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Package browser"></p>
<p>In addition to the base packages, we want to install the packages required for Cygwin/X. Cygwin/X is required for us to run GUI applications in our Linux virtual machine.
According to the Cygwin/X website, Cygwin/X requires the following packages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>xorg-server</li>
  <li>xinit</li>
  <li>openssh</li>
</ul>
<p>Switch to "Full" view, and type "xorg-server" in the search box.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-10.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Package browser"></p>
<p>The first package seems to be what we want.</p>
<p>Click the <code><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> Skip</code> button to cycle through options until the "New" column shows the latest version of xorg-server.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-11.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Package browser"></p>
<p>Switch back to the "Pending" view to confirm that xorg-server is selected for installation.
Notice that the base packages are hidden since we have typed "xorg-server" into the search filter box.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-12.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Package browser"></p>
<p>Click <code>Clear</code> to clear the search filter and see the full list of all pending operations.
This unhides the base packages that are selected for installation.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-13.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Package browser"></p>
<p>Return to the "Full" view and use the search filter to find xinit and openssh.
Select xinit and openssh for installation.
Return to the "Pending" view to review your pending operations.</p>
<p>Click <code>Next &gt;</code> to execute the pending operations.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-14.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Resolving dependencies"></p>
<p>Some of the packages we've selected depend on other packages.
Cygwin Setup computes the required dependencies and offers to install them for us.
This is a good thing.</p>
<p>Check the "Select required pacakges" checkbox, and click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-16.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Downloading and installing packages"></p>
<p>Cygwin Setup downloads and installs the selected packages.</p>
<p>Sit back and let it run.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-18.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Create icons and finish installation"></p>
<p>Congratulations! You've installed a base Cygwin environment with Cygwin/X.</p>
<p>Click <code>Finish</code> to exit Cygwin Setup.</p>
<p>Any time you want to install, uninstall, update, or reinstall packages in your Cygwin envirnoment, run the Cygwin Setup program.
Remember that clicking the <code><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> Skip</code> button cycles through the possible options for a package.
It's a confusing user interface, but you get used to it eventually.</p>
<h2>Cygwin Directory Structure</h2>
<p>Cygwin Setup installs all packages into the Cygwin root directory that you select.
The Cygwin root directory no different from any other directory on your computer.
It just happens to be the directory that the Cygwin environment considers to be it's root directory.
You can browse the Cygwin root directory in Windows Explorer to see the files that are installed.</p>
<p>The rest of this article will assume that <code>C:\cygwin</code> is the Cygwin root directory.</p>
<p>The Cygwin environment also has a home directory for each user on your system.
If your user name is "jdoe", then your Cygwin home directory is at <code>C:\cygwin\home\jdoe</code>.</p>
<p>Cygwin also creates a <code>C:\cygwin\cygdrive</code> directory.
The <code>C:\cygwin\cygdrive</code> directory contains shortcut links to each drive on your computer.
For example, <code>C:\cygwin\cygdrive\c\Users</code> is a shortcut to <code>C:\Users</code>.
If you have a <code>D:\</code> drive, you can access it via <code>C:\cygwin\cygdrive\d</code>.
The shortcut links in <code>C:\cygwin\cygdrive</code> allow you to access all files on your computer from within the Cygwin environment.</p>
<h2>Customize Cygwin and Cygwin/X</h2>
<p>To access the Cygwin command line environment, search for "Cygwin" in your Windows start menu.</p>
<p>When you first start the Cygwin terminal, it will look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/terminal-01.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin terminal"></p>
<p>Let's make this look a bit more attractive.
This is important since the look and feel of your environment affects your productivity.</p>
