<p>The first major hurdle you encounter when learning Linux is actually getting Linux installed on your computer.
Installing a completely foreign operating system is daunting, and you are not willing to risk breaking your current Windows installation.
Fortunately, we can use Cygwin, VirtualBox, and Vagrant to learn Linux without touching our current Windows installation.</p>
<p>In this article we'll create a virtual machine that has Linux already installed.
Then you can play around with Linux in the virtual machine, and if you break something, you can spawn a new virtual machine with a fresh Linux install.</p>
<h1>Cygwin</h1>
<p>The first piece of software we'll need is Cygwin.
Cygwin provides us with a Linux-like command line environment within Windows.</p>
<h2>Cygwin Intro</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to understand about Cygwin is that Cygwin is <strong>NOT</strong> a single program.
Cygwin is an environment that contains many programs and packages.
You can add or remove programs and packages from your Cygwin environment using the Cygwin Setup program.
The "setup.exe" file that you download from the Cygwin website is the Cygwin Setup program.</p>
<h2>Download Cygwin Setup</h2>
<p>Please use the button below to download Cygwin Setup now.</p>
<p><a href="https://cygwin.com/install.html" class="btn btn-lg btn-success" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt"></span> Download Cygwin</a></p>
<p>After you've downloaded the Cygwin Setup program, move the "setup.exe" file to a convenient permanent location.
Cygwin Setup will cache downloaded packages and package metadata in the same directory as the "setup.exe" file.
Typically, you keep this file in the same place to take advantage of the caching feature.
I usually place my "setup.exe" file in <code>C:\cygwin-setup</code></p>
<h2>Run Cygwin Setup</h2>
<p>Now we're ready to run Cygwin Setup and install our first Cygwin packages.
Double click the "setup.exe" file to run Cygwin Setup.</p>
<h3>1. Welcome Screen</h3>
<p>This welcome screen has some good information.
Give it a read, then click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-01.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Welcome screen"></p>
<h3>2. Choose Package Source</h3>
<p>Choose "Install from Internet".</p>
<p>Click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-02.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Choose package source"></p>
<h3>3. Choose Cygwin Root Directory</h3>
<p>Select the root directory where your Cygwin environment will be installed.
I usually choose <code>C:\cygwin</code> for my Cygwin root directory.</p>
<p>Click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>4. Choose Package Cache Directory</h3>
<p>Choose where you want Cygwin Setup to store its cached package files.
I usually store cached package files right next to "setup.exe" in <code>C:\cygwin-setup</code>.</p>
<p>Click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>5. Configure Network Settings</h3>
<p>Configure network settings appropriate for your Internet connection. I find that "Direct Connection" works well for me.</p>
<p>Click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-05.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Configure network settings"></p>
<h3>6. Choose a Mirror</h3>
<p>The official Cygwin package repository is available from multiple servers throughout the world.
They all have the same Cygwin packages available, but download times vary from server to server.
I usually just pick one at random.</p>
<p>If you get slow download speeds, try a different mirror.
You can check out the <a href="https://cygwin.com/mirrors.html">Cygwin mirrors list</a> and select a mirror that is close to your geographic location.</p>
<p>Choose a mirror, then click <code>Next &gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-06.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Choose a mirror"></p>
<h3>7. Downloading Package Metadata</h3>
<p>Cygwin Setup downloads the latest package metadata from your selected mirror and updates its local cache.</p>
<p>Sit back and let the download finish.</p>

<h3>8. Select Packages to Install</h3>
<p>Now we're ready to browse for packages and select the packages we want to install.</p>
<p>But first, let's explore the Cygwin package browser a little. Right now, we're looking at all Cygwin packages, organized by category.</p>
<p>Click the <code>View</code> button twice to see the packages that are currently selected for installation. (Hover your mouse over the <code>View</code> button for an explanation of the different "views".)</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-08.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Package browser"></p>
<p>Right now all of the packages under the "Base" category are selected for installation. (The Base category includes all packages required for a minimal Cygwin installation.)</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-09.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Package browser"></p>
<p>In addition to the base packages, we want to install the packages required for Cygwin/X. (Cygwin/X is required for us to run GUI applications in our Linux virtual machine.)
According to the Cygwin/X website, Cygwin/X requires the following packages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>xorg-server</li>
  <li>xinit</li>
  <li>openssh</li>
</ul>
<p>Switch to "Full" view, and type "xorg-server" into the search box.</p>
<p><img src="assets/png/cygwin-setup-10.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Cygwin Setup: Package browser"></p>
<p>The first package seems to be what we want.</p>
<p>Click the <code><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> Skip</code> button to cycle through options until the "New" column shows the latest version of xorg-server.</p>
